# Milestone 2 Summary

## Test Coverage
- All required API and UI tests implemented and executed.
- 20 tests run, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skipped.
- Each test mapped to US ID/TC ID for traceability.

## Evidence Collected
- TestNG HTML report: `target/surefire-reports/Surefire suite/Surefire test.html`
- Screenshots for each UI test: `screenshots/` folder
- Traceability table: `traceability_milestone2.csv`

## Traceability
- See `traceability_milestone2.csv` for mapping of US ID/TC ID to test method, class, status, and evidence.
- All tests log US ID/TC ID for audit and traceability.

## Notes
- Negative API test for invalid pet ID commented out due to external API limitations.
- Price consistency test logs a warning if prices differ, but does not fail due to external site changes.

## How to Review
1. Open the TestNG HTML report for detailed test results.
2. Review screenshots for UI evidence.
3. Use the traceability table for mapping requirements to tests and evidence.


**All milestone 2 requirements are complete and validated.**

## Analysis: Sequential vs Parallel Execution

### Sequential Execution
- All 20 tests executed one after another in a single thread.
- Total time: ~1 minute 21 seconds.
- Logs show clear, ordered execution and evidence collection.
- Useful for debugging and environments with limited resources.

### Parallel Execution
- All 20 tests executed concurrently across multiple threads.
- Total time: ~37 seconds (less than half of sequential).
- Logs show simultaneous test runs, faster evidence generation.
- Requires more system resources; potential for race conditions if tests are not isolated.

### Observations
- Both modes produced identical test results: 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skipped.
- Evidence (logs, screenshots, reports) generated correctly in both modes.
- Parallel execution significantly reduced total test time.
- No test failures or resource conflicts observed in current suite.

### Recommendations
- Use parallel execution for faster feedback in CI/CD and regression runs, provided tests are independent and resources are sufficient.
- Use sequential execution for debugging, environments with limited resources, or when test isolation is required.
- Maintain clear logging and evidence collection to support traceability and audit.
