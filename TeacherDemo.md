# Screenshot Capture Demo - Summary for Teacher

## Problem Statement
Your teacher asked: **"When UI tests fail, artifacts (screenshots) should be stored. No need for artifacts for successful tests, only for failed test cases."**

## What We Fixed ✅

### Before (❌ Wrong Implementation):
- Screenshots were captured for **ALL tests** (both passed and failed)
- Every test method had: `ScreenshotUtil.takeScreenshot(driver, executionId, testCaseId);`
- Created unnecessary artifacts for successful tests
- Inefficient storage usage

### After (✅ Correct Implementation):
- Screenshots are captured **ONLY for FAILED tests**
- Removed all individual screenshot calls from test methods
- Only `@AfterMethod` captures screenshots when `result.getStatus() == ITestResult.FAILURE`
- Efficient, focused artifact storage

## Technical Implementation

### @AfterMethod Logic:
```java
@AfterMethod
public void tearDown(ITestResult result) {
    String executionId = System.getProperty("executionId", "manual");
    String testCaseId = result.getMethod().getMethodName();
    boolean isFailure = result.getStatus() == ITestResult.FAILURE;
    
    try {
        // Screenshot ONLY for failed tests
        if (isFailure && driver != null) {
            ScreenshotUtil.takeScreenshot(driver, executionId, testCaseId);
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        logger.error("Screenshot failed: " + e.getMessage(), e);
    }
}
```

## Demo Tests for Teacher

### Test 1: Successful Test (No Screenshot)
```bash
mvn test -Dtest=BlazeDemoUITest#testHomePageLoad_TC_UI_01
```
**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS - No screenshot created

### Test 2: Failed Test (Screenshot Created)
```bash
mvn test -Dtest=BlazeDemoUITest#testDemoFailure
```
**Expected Result**: ❌ FAIL - Screenshot automatically created in `artifacts/manual/testDemoFailure/screenshot.png`

## API Access for Failed Test Screenshots

When a UI test fails, the screenshot can be accessed via:
```http
GET http://localhost:8081/api/artifacts/manual/testDemoFailure/screenshot.png
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Storage Efficiency**: Only stores artifacts when needed
2. **Clear Problem Identification**: Screenshots only exist for issues
3. **Debugging Focus**: Developers can quickly find failed test evidence  
4. **API Integration**: Failed test screenshots accessible via REST APIs
5. **Automatic Capture**: No manual intervention needed

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Artifacts Folder**: 
   - Before running tests: Note current contents
   - After successful test: No new screenshots added
   - After failed test: New screenshot appears

2. **Test the API**:
   - Access screenshot via browser or curl
   - Verify image shows the actual failure state

## Teacher Demonstration Script

1. **Show Current Implementation**: 
   - Explain `@AfterMethod` logic
   - Show removed screenshot calls from individual tests

2. **Run Successful Test**:
   - `mvn test -Dtest=BlazeDemoUITest#testHomePageLoad_TC_UI_01`
   - Show no new artifacts created

3. **Run Failed Test**:
   - `mvn test -Dtest=BlazeDemoUITest#testDemoFailure` 
   - Show screenshot created in artifacts folder

4. **Access via API**:
   - Open browser to: `http://localhost:8081/api/artifacts/manual/testDemoFailure/screenshot.png`
   - Show actual screenshot of the failed test

**"Ma'am, our framework now captures screenshots ONLY for failed UI tests, exactly as requested. This provides efficient storage and focused debugging capabilities."**
